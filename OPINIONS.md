# Own With AI - Brand Opinions & Positioning

> This document is the source of truth for our content strategy, messaging, and identity. All copy, curriculum, and communications should align with these principles.

## Our Core Belief

**The best EAs aren't competing with AI. They're orchestrating it.**

The EA profession is bifurcating. Traditional "admin-only" assistants are being commoditized by AI tools anyone can use. But EAs who can identify automation opportunities, wield AI tools fluently, AND build the systems themselves? They're becoming indispensable strategic partners.

We believe AI doesn't replace great EAs—it elevates them. The assistants who embrace these tools will replace those who don't.

---

## The Problem We Solve

### For EAs

1. **The career ceiling is low.** Most EAs hit the top of their pay band 10-15 years in, with nowhere to go. Traditional EA work offers limited upward mobility.

2. **Training doesn't exist.** 85% of employers have no training budget for support staff. Only 48% of EAs received any training in the last 6 months. The industry expects EAs to figure out AI on their own.

3. **Burnout is rampant.** EAs are "unsung heroes" whose contributions fly under the radar. They feel undervalued despite carrying heavy workloads. This is the #1 reason premium EAs leave.

4. **Commoditization is coming.** Basic admin tasks are being automated. EAs who only manage calendars and inboxes will struggle to justify their rates.

### For Clients

1. **Too busy doing tasks to build systems.** Founders and executives know AI could help, but they don't have time to figure it out. They're stuck in a loop of reactive task execution.

2. **Traditional EAs don't touch processes.** A typical EA handles your inbox but won't redesign your workflows. You need someone who thinks in systems, not just tasks.

3. **AI expertise is expensive and scarce.** Hiring an automation consultant or AI strategist costs $200+/hour and doesn't help with daily execution.

## Our Unique Position

**We're a training-first company that happens to place EAs.**

Other agencies vet and match. We *transform*.

- **BELAY**: Vets for culture fit and reliability. Great EAs, but no AI training.
- **Boldly**: W-2 employment model with corporate EA backgrounds. Premium but traditional.
- **Athena**: Top 0.5% talent from Philippines with AI tools access. Scale-focused.
- **Freelance**: EAs on their own, figuring it out solo.

**Own With AI**: We train EAs in a specific AI workflow methodology, then match them with clients who want transformation—not just task execution.

Our moat is the curriculum. The supply of truly AI-enabled EAs is constrained because the training doesn't exist elsewhere.

## What "AI-Enabled" Actually Means

We reject the idea that "using ChatGPT sometimes" makes someone AI-enabled. Our EAs have the full stack:

### 1. Identify Opportunities
- Spot repetitive patterns in a client's workflow
- Recognize what CAN be automated vs. what shouldn't be
- Create "AI-ification roadmaps" that show clear ROI

### 2. Use AI Tools Fluently
- Prompt engineering: craft prompts that get consistent, high-quality results
- Know which tool fits which problem (ChatGPT vs. Claude vs. specialized tools)
- Build prompt libraries for common EA tasks

### 3. Build Systems (No-Code)
- Zapier, Make (Integromat) for workflow automation
- Connect AI outputs to business tools (Slack, Notion, email, CRMs)
- Create end-to-end automations that run without manual intervention

**Technical depth: No-code only.** We don't teach Python or API development. Our EAs build with visual tools that don't require engineering skills. This keeps the barrier accessible while still delivering real automation.

## The Promise to EAs

### Career Evolution, Not Just a Job

We offer a path from "assistant" to "AI transformation partner":

```
Traditional EA → AI Workflow Expert → Transformation Partner → Chief of Staff
```

**What this means concretely:**
- Command premium rates ($50-100+/hr instead of $25-40)
- Work with clients who understand and value AI transformation
- Do more interesting, strategic work—not just inbox management
- Build a defensible skillset as AI disrupts traditional admin roles
- Join a community of forward-thinking peers

### What We Don't Promise
- Get rich quick
- Work with zero client interaction
- Passive income from automations
- Replacement for hard work and curiosity

---

## The Promise to Clients

### Compounding Productivity Gains

You're not just hiring task execution. You're hiring someone who:
- Handles your tasks TODAY (email, scheduling, research, admin)
- Identifies automation opportunities as they work
- Builds AI systems that make you faster EVERY MONTH

**The compounding effect:** Each automation frees time for the next improvement. Month 1, you get an EA. Month 6, you have an EA plus a suite of custom AI workflows that multiply your output.

### What Clients Should Expect
- Immediate task relief (week 1)
- First automation opportunities identified (week 2-3)
- Working AI workflows deployed (month 1-2)
- Continuous optimization ongoing

### What We Don't Promise
- Magical AI that reads your mind
- Replacement for clear communication and delegation
- Automations for genuinely complex judgment calls
- Instant transformation (this takes weeks, not days)

---

## Voice & Tone Guidelines

### We Sound Like
- A smart friend who's figured out AI workflows and wants to share
- Confident but not arrogant
- Practical over theoretical
- Direct and clear—no corporate jargon

### We Avoid
- Hype language ("revolutionary," "game-changing," "disruptive")
- Fear-mongering about AI replacing jobs
- Overpromising timelines or results
- Talking down to either EAs or clients
- Jargon that sounds impressive but means nothing

### Sample Phrases We'd Use
- "Stop doing work AI should handle"
- "Your EA handles tasks. Our EAs build systems."
- "Task execution + workflow transformation in one"
- "The EAs who master AI workflows will command premium rates"

### Sample Phrases We'd Avoid
- "Leverage synergies to optimize your workflow paradigm"
- "AI will replace all EAs" (fear-mongering)
- "Become a millionaire working 4 hours a week" (hype)
- "Our proprietary AI technology" (we use existing tools)

## Content Pillars

### Topics We Own
1. **AI workflow training for EAs** - What to learn, how to learn it, practical applications
2. **Automation opportunity identification** - How to spot patterns, assess ROI, prioritize builds
3. **No-code automation building** - Zapier, Make, prompt libraries, tool integrations
4. **EA career evolution** - Moving from admin to strategic partner
5. **The delegation mindset** - For clients: how to work with an AI-enabled EA

### Topics We Avoid
- General productivity tips (oversaturated)
- Hot takes on AGI or AI safety (not our lane)

## Training Curriculum Philosophy

### What We Teach

**Module 1: AI Workflow Audit**
- Analyzing a client's current workflow
- Identifying high-impact automation opportunities
- Creating an "AI-ification roadmap" with clear ROI

**Module 2: Prompt Engineering**
- Principles of effective prompting
- Building consistent, high-quality prompt templates
- Creating prompt libraries for common EA tasks

**Module 3: No-Code Automation**
- Zapier fundamentals: triggers, actions, multi-step zaps
- Make (Integromat) for complex workflows
- Connecting AI outputs to business tools

**Module 4: Real Workflow Templates**
- Email triage and smart categorization
- Research synthesis and summarization
- Meeting prep and follow-up automation
- Content drafting workflows
- CRM and data entry automation

**Module 5: Client Communication**
- Presenting AI opportunities to clients
- Managing expectations
- Demonstrating value and ROI

**Module 6: Tool-Agnostic Thinking**
- Underlying principles that transfer across tools
- Staying current as AI tools evolve
- Evaluating new tools critically

### Why No-Code Only

1. **Accessibility**: EAs shouldn't need engineering skills
2. **Speed**: No-code tools allow rapid prototyping and iteration
3. **Maintainability**: Clients can understand and modify workflows
4. **Focus**: We'd rather EAs be great at no-code than mediocre at coding

### Why This Curriculum

The question isn't "Can you schedule meetings?" but "Can you use AI to analyze patterns, synthesize information, and build systems that make your client faster?"

We train the full stack because partial knowledge isn't enough:
- Tool proficiency alone = you can use ChatGPT but don't know when to
- Identification alone = you see opportunities but can't execute
- Building alone = you make things that don't solve real problems

The combination is what creates value.
