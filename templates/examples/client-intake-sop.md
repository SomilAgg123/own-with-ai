**Frequency**: Per new client engagement (approximately 3-5 per month)

**Estimated Duration**: 45-60 minutes (discovery call) + 30 minutes (documentation)

**Process Type**: Quality-focused (accuracy of requirements critical for successful placement)

---

## Trigger

This process starts when:

- [ ] OR existing client requests a new role search

---

## Inputs Required

| Input | Source | Format | Required | Notes |
|-------|--------|--------|----------|-------|
| Signed retainer agreement | Email/DocuSign | PDF | Yes | Must have payment confirmed |
| Client contact details | CRM or email | Name, email, phone | Yes | Primary hiring manager |
| Company website | Client | URL | Yes | For research prep |
| Initial role description | Client email | Free text | No | Often incomplete, will clarify on call |
| Org chart (if available) | Client | PDF/image | No | Helps understand reporting structure |

---

## Steps

### Step 1: Pre-Call Research

**Action**: Research the client company before discovery call

**Tool/System**: Web browser, LinkedIn, company website

**Tasks**:
1. Review company website (About, Leadership, News sections)
2. Check LinkedIn company page for recent updates, headcount, growth signals
3. Search recent news for funding, acquisitions, leadership changes
4. Note any existing placements we've made with this client

**Expected Output**: 1-page research brief with company context

---

### Step 2: Prepare Discovery Call Agenda

**Action**: Create structured agenda from template

**Tool/System**: Google Docs, template library

**Agenda sections**:
1. Confirm role basics (title, team, reporting line)
2. Understand the "why now" (new role, backfill, growth)
3. Define ideal candidate profile
4. Discuss compensation range and flexibility
5. Align on timeline and process
6. Identify potential sourcing challenges

**Expected Output**: Customized call agenda sent to client 24h before call

---

### Step 3: Conduct Discovery Call ⚠️ DECISION POINT

**Action**: Run the discovery call, capture all requirements

**Tool/System**: Zoom/Google Meet, note-taking tool

**Decision Criteria**:
| Condition | Action |
|-----------|--------|
| Client provides clear, specific requirements | Document as stated, proceed to Step 4 |
| Client requirements are vague ("we need a rockstar") | Probe with specific questions: "What does success look like in 6 months?" |
| Client expectations seem unrealistic (salary vs. requirements mismatch) | Flag tactfully, provide market data, note as risk |
| Client unsure about key details (reporting line, team size) | Schedule follow-up call, do not proceed until clarified |

**Key Questions to Cover**:
- What does the ideal candidate look like? (must-haves vs nice-to-haves)
- What's the team culture like?
- Why did the last person leave / why is this role new?
- What's the interview process and timeline?
- Who are the decision makers?
- What's the compensation range? (base, bonus, equity)
- Any deal-breakers or red flags we should know about?

**Expected Output**: Detailed call notes with all requirements captured

---

### Step 4: Assess Search Difficulty ⚠️ DECISION POINT

**Action**: Evaluate how difficult this search will be

**Tool/System**: Internal scoring rubric, LinkedIn Recruiter talent pool check

**Decision Criteria**:
| Condition | Action |
|-----------|--------|
| Talent pool > 500 matches, reasonable comp | Standard search, 4-6 week timeline |
| Talent pool 100-500 matches, comp at market | Moderate difficulty, 6-8 week timeline |
| Talent pool < 100 matches OR comp below market | Difficult search, discuss with client, may need to adjust requirements |
| Niche skills + specific location + below-market comp | Escalate to Principal, may need to renegotiate terms |

**Expected Output**: Difficulty assessment (Easy/Moderate/Hard/Very Hard) with rationale

---

### Step 5: Draft Client Brief

**Action**: Create structured client brief document

**Tool/System**: Google Docs, client brief template

**Document sections**:
1. Company overview (from research)
2. Role summary (title, team, reporting, location/remote)
3. Candidate requirements (must-haves, nice-to-haves)
4. Compensation & benefits
5. Interview process & timeline
6. Search strategy & sourcing plan
7. Risk factors (if any)

**Expected Output**: Complete client brief ready for internal review

---

### Step 6: Internal Review ⚠️ DECISION POINT

**Action**: Review brief with team lead or principal

**Tool/System**: Slack, Google Docs comments

**Decision Criteria**:
| Condition | Action |
|-----------|--------|
| Brief is complete, strategy approved | Proceed to Step 7 |
| Missing information identified | Return to client for clarification before proceeding |
| Strategy disagreement | Escalate to Principal for alignment |
| Red flags identified (client reputation, unrealistic expectations) | Escalate to Principal, may recommend declining engagement |

**Expected Output**: Approved client brief with any revisions incorporated

---

### Step 7: Create Search Kickoff Package

**Action**: Prepare all materials needed to begin active sourcing

**Tool/System**: Google Docs, ATS, LinkedIn Recruiter

**Package contents**:
1. Finalized client brief
2. Boolean search strings for LinkedIn
3. Target company list (competitors, adjacent industries)
4. Candidate outreach message templates (3 versions)
5. ATS job record created with all details

**Expected Output**: Complete kickoff package in shared drive folder

---

### Step 8: Send Client Confirmation

**Action**: Send confirmation email to client with next steps

**Tool/System**: Gmail, email template

**Email includes**:
1. Summary of what we heard on the call
2. Confirmed timeline and milestones
3. Our search strategy overview
4. What we need from them (job description review, interview availability)
5. Next touchpoint scheduled

**Expected Output**: Confirmation email sent, calendar invite for first check-in

---

## Outputs / Deliverables

| Output | Destination | Format | Recipient |
|--------|-------------|--------|-----------|
| Pre-call research brief | Internal shared drive | Google Doc | Recruiter assigned |
| Call notes | CRM activity log | Structured notes | Internal team |
| Client brief | Shared drive + ATS | Google Doc | Internal team |
| Kickoff package | Shared drive | Folder with all materials | Recruiter assigned |

## Quality Checks

Before marking this process complete, verify:

- [ ] All "must-have" requirements are specific and measurable (not vague like "good communicator")
- [ ] Compensation range is confirmed in writing (email or doc)
- [ ] Timeline is realistic given difficulty assessment
- [ ] Client brief has been reviewed by team lead
- [ ] ATS record is complete with all fields populated
- [ ] Client has confirmed receipt of summary email

---

## Escalation Triggers

Escalate to a human when:

| Trigger | Escalate To | Information to Include |
|---------|-------------|----------------------|
| Client provides conflicting requirements | Team Lead | Specific contradictions, what was said on call |
| Compensation significantly below market (>20%) | Principal | Market data, client rationale, risk assessment |
| Client wants unrealistic timeline (<2 weeks for senior role) | Principal | Standard timelines, client urgency reason |
| Red flags about client (reputation, payment history) | Principal | Source of concern, specific information |
| Candidate already placed with this client previously | Team Lead | Previous placement details, any issues |

---

## Error Handling

| Error Type | Response | Recovery Action |
|------------|----------|-----------------|
| Client no-shows discovery call | Send polite follow-up within 2 hours | Reschedule within 48 hours, if 2nd no-show escalate to Principal |
| Key stakeholder unavailable for call | Note gap in information | Schedule follow-up call with that stakeholder before finalizing brief |
| CRM/ATS system down | Document in Google Docs temporarily | Transfer to system within 24 hours of restoration |
| Client brief template missing fields | Flag to ops team | Use previous brief as backup template |

---

## Version History

| Version | Date | Author | Changes |
|---------|------|--------|---------|
| 1.0 | 2025-01-29 | [Team Lead] | Initial creation from process audit |

## Notes for Agent Implementation

- **Execution Trace**: Generate a trace log for each run (see `execution-trace-template.md`)
- **Confidence Thresholds**: Flag any step where confidence drops below 80%
- **Human Handoff**: The discovery call (Step 3) must remain human-led; agent supports with prep and documentation
- **Learning**: Track patterns in what makes requirements "vague" to improve pre-call agenda

---

*This SOP is designed to be executed by an AI agent with human oversight at marked decision points. The discovery call itself remains human-led.*
