## Notes for Agent Implementation

- **Execution Trace**: Generate a trace log for each run (see `execution-trace-template.md`)
- **Confidence Thresholds**: Flag any step where confidence drops below 80%
- **Human Handoff**: When escalating, preserve full context and reasoning
- **Learning**: Note any patterns or edge cases for SOP improvement

*This SOP is designed to be executed by an AI agent with human oversight at marked decision points.*
